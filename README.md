Description:
The purpose of my website is to showcase a couple of my projects, experiences, and interests in my own style. My website has information about my educational background and professional interests, my resume, and projects from different courses. I only showcased the three because I felt they were the most diverse projects that were able to display a wide variety of my skills (programming, design, prototyping) and team experiences (individual and group work). In addition, to add a more personal touch, I added a couple of my hobbies on my about me page.  

It is interesting and engaging because it’s also a reflection of my personality and interests. For example, I’m going to be working in New York City this summer so the background is a skyline of New York. I also designed the different icons and project pages. The target audience is other college students and potential employers because they’re able to see how I’ve been able to apply my skills not only through the projects and resume, but also through the site design itself. 

Using the Website

Home page: The user is able to look at the typing animation and click on the different parts of my education (links to each respective site, Business Administration → Tepper Website etc.)

Project page: The user can click on each of the projects (Marketpal, HealthConnect, Pivot) and learn more about it and look at the final deliverables. 

About me: The user can view a picture of myself and a small snippet about me, my professional interests, and hobbies. 

Resume: The user can view and download a PDF of my most recent resume. 

External Libraries

Javascript: I used Javascript to make the animation of the typing effect on the home page. I knew I wanted the animation but wasn’t able to achieve it with JQuery, but using a Javascript function I was able to replicate a typewriter. It makes my website more engaging without being too distracting. 

Bootstrap: I used bootstrap to make my webpage responsive because it was the most flexible with the variety of images and text I had. This way, a user is able to view the website properly no matter what kind of interface they’re on. 

Iterations from HW7:
Originally in HW 7, I was just going to go for a more simple and minimalistic design. However, I thought the icons I designed would be a better reflection of my personality. I also added additional colors that matched the general color scheme.


Challenges:
The biggest challenge I had was when I was implementing my javascript animation. I wanted it to be engaging but not distracting from the rest of the page, which I was able to achieve with the typing effect.
